All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer
Anytime people want to start problems
It's like "for real, are you dumb?"
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Say fe
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, this shit ain't gonna stop
You know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better
Look
Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...
Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...
Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...
Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'mma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...
Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...
Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...
Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...
Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I'll go without you
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am....
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing to never lose me
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the "are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin' make sure you tell me
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
Remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow, Ohhh, ohhh!
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me
I try with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning in the hype
Me, I'm just dunning in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
One of dem ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back to where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain't how it always seems when it's sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through
the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now, yeah
Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' with just me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And that is too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
At second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
Yeah, I can't get enough of you, babe
Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby
M.I.A. in the M.I.A
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl
Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real
I can't fake that, babe
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
You're the only one I trust with it
You're the only one that stuck with it
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you
Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choose your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you around, I need you, oh
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you, I'm with you
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a, not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games cause they feel like they know me
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game
This ain't no motherfucking '91
We out here rapping for money you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
You would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
You hit me like "I know you're there with someone else"
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog
How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son, tho
Nothing mutual about my funds, bout my funds, tho
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at
How they feel about you, where you're from, where your bed at
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time, tho

I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though he isn't near me
Based on what I got it's hard to think that he don't hear me
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6 point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci

You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still
Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear talkin, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams who Im racing with
But, You can see I'm pacin it so that I'm always chasin it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own,
but its lookin like July 4th
But I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time Im really goin off,
Fireworks!!!
When I go off like July 4th

what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me

that felt good,
all and all I learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now I see it in her eyes
Fireworks!
Everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that I still listen
and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city I let her explore
ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first,
that's why I'm really going off, Fireworks!
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I should have gotten back by now
but you know how much I wanted to make it
it's proabably better anyhow
so if you gotta go
if theres anything I should know
if the spotlight makes you nervous
if you looking for a purpose
you put the tea in the kettle and light it
put your hand on the metal and feel it
but do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
now I'm all singing Karaoke
further than I've ever been
so if you gotta go
if there's any way I can help
Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
that tells me my life is too much and it moves to Atlanta
damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know
I always up too late I worry bout you there alone
in that place you call your home
warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
but that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
secrets you were telling everybody but me
don't be fooled by the money I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous
and you looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous
Yesterday when we were getting high, you were invited.
You would've liked it. I-I know you all too well.
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye, but you weren't excited,
there's no way to fight it.
You can stay but shawty here I go...
Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it.
I mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it.
I am, still here with who I started with.
The game needed life, I put my heart in it.
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit.
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.
Uh. I'm 23, with a money tree.
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.
It's ironic, 'cause my mother was a flourist,
and that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enourmous.
It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.
I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.
Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.
I'm trying to do better than good enough.
What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.
But people I don't have the time to hang with,
always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)
You promised me you would never change.
You promised me you would never change.
Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.
Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.
But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,
that I barley know at all and..
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is,
I'm holding on by a thread it's..
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now,
and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,
cause we just having the time of our lives right now.
What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.
But people I don't have the time to hang with,
always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)
You promised me you would never change.
You promised you would never change.
Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.
The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.
Which made me question when I went missing.
And when I start treating my friends different.
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.
Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.
Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.
I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.
I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets.
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?
I just need some closure.
Aint no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.
I know way to many people here now right now,

And I'm ready for that, Im just sayin,
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher,
Two thumbs up, Ebert & Roper,

But ill prolly still be the man when everything is over,
So im ridin thru the city with my high beams on,

If you thinkin Ima quit before I die dream on,

you say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
and you don't do it for the man, men never notice
you just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest
intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
long as they got a little class like half days
and the confidence to overlook my past ways
time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
but they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
and look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together
oh you fancy huh
nail done, hair done, everything done
nails done, hair done, everything done
oh you fancy huh

Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
from all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
they get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car
unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
make it rain finger (check)
M3 beamer (check)
Champagne range

closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel

Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
and when I find it is when I find you
and we can do the things we never got the time to
better late than never
but never late is better
they tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever
you just lead the way
we go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
and Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
how she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
the girls that got diplomas
and enough money to loan us a little something extra
should we ever need it
if it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it
These girls ain't got nothing on you
Uhh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm Searching for
All the girls they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of Something you got
It's obvious you are pretty
Heard that your a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what your doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures
Shut it down down down
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it, hey oh
These girls aint got nothing on you nothing on you
What you need
I can be (I can be)
Your everything

Them other niggas
Just wanna hit it but if they had it
Wouldn't know what to do with it
(And together)
We shut it down down down
They know we shut it down down down
Your the baddest girl around..
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that muthafucker down down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that muthafucker down down down
Oh yeah,
Yes indeed, you shut it down down
Drizzzy, The American Dream
You shut that shit down
You shut it down
Let me know, let me know, ohhh ohhh
Let me know, let me know
Yo, this is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I haven't slept in days,
and me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways, so I'm single
Thinking about what we had and missing you,
But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the women that I brought out
Baby, don't hold on too long 'cause thats how them stories start out,
And all those girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out,
it's Drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can't escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave,
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save, but I'm good
I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle,
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came,
And no matter where I'm headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I'm the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters,
And when you get to talkin' bout the greatest
I just really hope that (you'd think of me)
I'm doin my thing
('Cause I'm trynna be unforgettable)
This just might be my realest flow ever,
When I say for life, y'all say forever
It's hard, but its fair, I told that girl "Life hurts"
The closest you gonna get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young, baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young, so I'mma need a thug wife
Yeah, I'm talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry prolly louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I'm in my "used to have to sneak the car"
Now my insides are lookin like a snickers bar
Yeah, I'm talking caramel leathers,
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
She saying shit in them streets, so whats the deal?
And I've done everything in the A, but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life, no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her name's the Game
Got this top dropped on this beautiful night
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got em lil brah,
Unforgettable, you'll never forget this, ya understand me?
Timeless homie, unforgettable
Let me know, let me know
I been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking, how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me nobody's workin' as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all of the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous, prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown-man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load up a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was in Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow goose
Yeah, and I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, Hov, hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me
Who would have thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make it go
Oh, ho's turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' 'round with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's is how they gon' come at you
With silly raps for you, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumbs could gun 'em off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do
Who would have thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make it go
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl
When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though
I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget?
How you feel
And though you were my first time
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road
Til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches and limes, the sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free, my tv ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches and lime, a sweet life
A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born, yeah
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
And the water, is exactly what I wanted
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
It's just money, I'mma make more
No, no no no no no
Please decondition yourself
It's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
Absolutely nothing
Let's see, I have
Ooh yeah, I'mma make myself a hot link when I get home
It meant nothing to you
Savin' my seven dollars
Too many bottles of this wine we cant pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Start my day up on the roof

There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back 3 times a day
This shower head feels so amazin'
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do
Too many bottles of this wine we cant pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Oh, real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Oh, real love
Close your eyes for what you can't imagine; we are the xany gnashin'
Caddy smashin' bratty ass; he mad, he snatched his daddy's jag
And used the shit for batting practice, adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panicking, patch me up; Pappy done latch keyed us
Toyin' with Raggy Annes and mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts; don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits?
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down kike 60 stories
And some do't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash
Too many bottles of this wine we cant pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love (ain't that something rare)
I'm searchin' a real love (talking 'bout real love)
Real love, yea
Real love (Real love)
Talking 'bout a real love
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator ice cold baby I told you
I'm ice cold
You out here flying high
Go ahead fly that thing
High high
But fly alone
You're always smoking in the house
What if my mother comes over you can't getup & get a job
Cause this little hustle's getting you by
you're the dealer & the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known
(I knew what I was on)
I had a pilot jones
(What you know about him)
She took me high
(Oh did she now)
Then she took me home (we talkin bout)
Pilot jones pilot jones.
Tonight you came stumbling across my lawn again
I just don't know why
I keep on trying to keep a grown woman sober see
There you go reaching up your blouse
And no I don't want a child
But I aint been touched in awhile
By the dealer & the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known (I knew what I was on)

"Pilot Jones" Lyrics

Frank Ocean

We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator ice cold baby I told you
I'm ice cold
You out here flying high
Go ahead fly that thing
High high
But fly alone

You're always smoking in the house
What if my mother comes over you can't getup & get a job
Cause this little hustle's getting you by
you're the dealer & the stoner

With the sweetest kiss I've ever known
(I knew what I was on)

I had a pilot jones
(What you know about him)
She took me high
(Oh did she now)
Then she took me home (we talkin bout)
Pilot jones pilot jones.
Tonight you came stumbling across my lawn again
I just don't know why
I keep on trying to keep a grown woman sober see
There you go reaching up your blouse
And no I don't want a child
But I aint been touched in awhile
By the dealer & the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known (I knew what I was on)
I had a pilot jones.
(What you know about him)
She took me high
(Oh did she now)
Then she took me home
(We talkin bout)
Pilot jones pilot jones
In the sky up above the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before you thought
I was above you
Above this in
So many ways
But if i got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place I'ma get one
I need ya
Admit it
You're my pilot jones.
you don't know how little you matter
until you're all alone
in the middle of arkansas
with a little rock left in that glass dick
used to date a blonde
you used to hit it raw
cause she was & you are madly involved
madly involved
hittin stones in glass homes
youre smokin stones in abandoned homes you hit them stones
broke your home crack rock crack rock
crack rock crack rock
hittin stones in glass homes
youre smokin stones in abandoned homes youre hittin stones
broke your home crack rock crack rock
crack rock crack rock
Youre shuckin & jivin
stealin & robbin
to get the fixing that you're itching for
Set the cheetahs on the looose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken cleopatra
Run run run come back for my glory
Bring her back to me
Run run run the crown of our pharaoh
The throne of our queen is empty
And we'll run to the future
Shining like diamonds in a rocky world
A rocky, rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhthym
On the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramid
Tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramid
Voices fill up the halls
Set the cheetahs on the looose
Theres a thief out on the move
Underneath our legions view
They have taken cleopatra
The jewel of Africa
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious
How could you run off on me?
How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson
And his full head of hair
Found my black queen Cleopatra
Bad dreams Cleopatra
Remove her
Send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over our queen has met her doom
No more she lives no more serpent in her room
No more it has killed Cleopatra
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl for now let's call her Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six inch heels
Catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
Shes working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne
Let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model tv with the vcr
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank
But it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
You showed up after work I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga
But I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it
Ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more
But your love ain't free no more
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
don't no one hear the sound
don't no one hear the rounds
don't no one hear the shells
don't no one hear a sound
don't no one disturb the peace for riot
don't no one disrupt nirvana
don't no one wanna blow the high
crack rock
how you feeling girl how's the gutter doing
Big full breasts on my baby (Yo we goin' to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weight the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been goin' to work
Boss ain't workin' you like this
He can't take care of you like this
Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weight the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live, too weird to die)
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
No, have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught?
She's at a stove (Who)
Can't believe I got her out here cookin' dope (Cookin' dope)
I promise she'll be
Whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothin' wrong (Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
No nothin' wrong with a lie
Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride
(Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)
Love love
Love lost
Life is the substance
Then the other channel
mosh pits & bare chest
stage diving sky diver
spray the crowd with cold water
now its mosh pits & wet tits
i think i need a cold shower
cool waters
african girl speaks in english accent likes to fuck boys in bands
likes to watch westerns
ride me without the hands
show me her passport
she's on her own tour
but youre beautiful to me
wave em high girl to the sky
but you're beautiful to me
(we're in the clouds)
wave em high girl to the sky
but you're beautiful to me
(life in the clouds)
keep em high ya'll
(beautiful stars)
in the sky
monks in the mosh pit
stage diving dalai lama
feet covered in cut flowers
they mosh for enlightenment
clean chakra good karma
one with the water
indian girl sleeps above the temple planning a run away young at heart
you found a boyfriend
now you wanna get away
just a virgin lover on a getaway
at sunset they're gonna try & get away abhaya mudra
i never ask for much
but please keep up lover
we've got no choices left
the running's fast
run run run run
you're beautiful to me
run run run run you'd better run
you mean so much to me
in my world
we made it safely
even with your father's army trailing us
we escaped him
even with his archer's bows at our backs
what a great escape
but theres a long way still in fact
we're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
there's a monsoon that never ends
a coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
to guide & protect us til the end
we're in the clouds
wave em high now to the sky
but you're beautiful to me
keep em high ya'll show you right but you're beautiful to me beautiful
Taxi driver
be my shrink for the hour
leave the meter running
its rush hour
so take the streets if you wanna just outrun the demons could you
he said allah hu akbar
i told him don't curse me
bo bo you need prayer
i guess it couldn't hurt me
if it brings me to my knees it's a bad religion
this unrequited love
to me its nothing but a one man cult
cyanide in my styrofoam cup
i could never make him love me
never make him love me
love me love me love me love me
love me love me
love me love me love me love
taxi driver i swear i've got three lives
balanced on my head like steak knives
i can't tell you the truth about my disguise
i can't trust no one
& you say allah hu akbar
i told him don't curse me
bo bo you need prayer
i guessed it couldn't hurt me
if it brings me to my knees
it's a bad religion
unrequited love
to me its nothing but a one man cult
cyanide in my styrofoam cup
i could never make him love me
never make him love me
no no
it's a it's a bad religion
to be in love with
someone who could never love you only bad only bad religion
could have me feeling the way i do
And the peaches and the mangos that you could sell for me
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind
This great great matter
Sensei replied what is your woman
Is she just a container for the child
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Close my eyes and fall into you
My god she's giving me pleasure
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My god, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter
Since you been gone
I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all had to tell myself naw
She's better with some fella with a regular job
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sittin in awe
Hops into my car drove far
Far's too close and I remember
My memories no sharp
Butter knife what a life anyway
I'm building y'all a clock stop
What am I Hemingway
She had the kind of body
That would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern
Not me cousin
If models are made for modeling
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend
I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man
We'd flee to other lands
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter
You're good at being bad
You're bad at being good
For heaven sakes go to hell
Knock, knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad
You're bad at being good
For heaven sakes go to hell
Knock on wood
For heaven sakes go to hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well frankly when that Ocean so muphuckin good
Make her swab the muthafuckin wood
Make her walk the muthafuckin plank
Make her rob a muthafuckin bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver
